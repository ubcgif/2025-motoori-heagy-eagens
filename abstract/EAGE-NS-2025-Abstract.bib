	abstract = {The Python-code empymod computes the 3D electromagnetic field in a layered earth with vertical transverse isotropy by combining and extending two earlier presented algorithms in this journal. The bottleneck in frequency- and time-domain calculations of electromagnetic responses derived in the wavenumber-frequency domain is the transformations from the wavenumber to the space domain and from the frequency to the time domain, the so-called Hankel and Fourier transforms. Three different Hankel transform methods (quadrature, quadrature-with-extrapolation [QWE], and filters) and four different Fourier transform methods (fast Fourier transform [FFT], FFTLog, QWE, and filters) are included in empymod, which allows us to compare these different methods in terms of speed and precision. The best transform in terms of speed and precision depends on the modeled frequencies. Published digital filters for the Hankel transform are very fast and precise for frequencies in the range of controlled-source electromagnetic data, but they fail in the frequency range of ground-penetrating radar. Conventional quadrature, on the other hand, is in comparison very slow but can model any frequency. Examples comparing empymod with analytical solutions and with existing electromagnetic modelers illustrate the capabilities of empymod.},

	abstract = {In‐situ complex resistivity measurements over the frequency range [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] have been made on 26 North American massive sulfide, graphite, magnetite, pyrrhotite, and porphyry copper deposits. The results reveal significant differences between the spectral responses of massive sulfides and graphite and present encouragement for their differentiation in the field. There are also differences between the spectra of magnetite and nickeliferrous pyrrhotite mineralization, which may prove useful in attempting to distinguish between these two common IP sources in nickel sulfide exploration. Lastly, there are differences in the spectra typically arising from the economic mineralization and the barren pyrite halo in porphyry copper systems. It appears that all these differences arise mainly from mineral texture, since laboratory studies of different specific mineral‐electrolyte interfaces show relatively small variations. All of the in‐situ spectra may be described by one or two simple Cole‐Cole relaxation models. Since the frequency dependence of these models is typically only about 0.25, and the frequency dependence of inductive electromagnetic coupling is near 1.0, it is possible to recognize and to remove automatically the effects of inductive coupling from IP spectra. The spectral response of small deposits or of deeply buried deposits varies from that of the homogeneous earth response, but these variations may be readily determined from the same “dilution factor” [Formula: see text] currently used to calculate apparent IP effects.},

	abstract = {Throughout this book there are numerous cases where geophysics has been used to help solve practical environmental, geotechnical, and exploration problems. The typical scenario is first to identify the physical property that is diagnostic of the sought geologic structure or buried object, for example, density, seismic velocity, electrical conductivity, or magnetic susceptibility. The appropriate geophysical survey is then designed and field data are acquired and plotted. In some cases the information needed to solve the problem may be obtained directly from these plots, but in most cases more information about the subsurface is required. As an example, consider the magnetic field anomaly map presented in Figure 2. The existence of a buried object, and also approximate horizontal locations, can be inferred directly from that image. The map, however, presents no information about the depth of the object or details regarding its shape. To obtain that information the data need to be inverted to generate a 3D subsurface distribution of the magnetic material.},
