Seafloor hydrothermal deposits are polymetallic massive sulfide ore
deposits formed by the precipitation of metal components contained in
hot water ejected from the seafloor. The sea depth is 700- 2000m. Ore
bodies extend hundreds of meters horizontally and tens of meters
vertically. Ore bodies are exposed on the sea floor. Some lab-based
petrophysics study indicates that resistivity and chargeability are
diagnostic physical properties, even compared with seawater (3.0-3.5
S/m). Time-domain electromagnetic methods (TEM) are sensitive to
variations in resistivity. WISTEM (Waseda integrated seafloor
time-domain electromagnetic exploration) surveys have been conducted in
several areas. Negative transients, which are due to induced
polarization effects (IP), have been observed for data collected over
known deposits. It is important to understand the system response to
invert these data. The pressure vessel (PV), which contains the
transmitter and receivers, can impact the data. We use numerical
simulations to quantify these effects, and we develop a workflow for
estimating a linear filter which captures the effects of the PV. This
filter will then be used in subsequent simulations and inversions.
Finally, we perform one-dimensional time-domain IP inversion of the
field data. The estimated resistivity and IP parameters agree with
physical property measurements from the area.
